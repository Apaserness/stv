JLCPCB (https://jlcpcb.com/HAR) is a company that focuses in prototyping PCBs and SMT assembly. JLCPCB guarantees quality, high precision, and fast board production, which was the primary reason we selected this company for the PCB production. 

JLCPCB's website (https://jlcpcb.com/) offers a service that allows users to upload the Gerber file required for manufacturing, after which, there are numerous configurations that can be managed to meet the needs of the user, such as layers, delivery format, pcb color, and so on. 

One of their standout features is that users can include a pcb stencil in their order and configure it on the website.
